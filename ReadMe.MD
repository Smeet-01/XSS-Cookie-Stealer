# XSS Cookie Stealer

Original Script by Ahmed Shawky @lnxg33k, repository found [here](https://github.com/lnxg33k/misc).

Minor changes made to the script to enable it to be run in Python3, owing to the legacy status of Python2. 

### Changes:
> Changed all 'print' statements to appropriate Python3 syntax.

> Changed import source from 'BaseHTTPServer' to 'http.server'. 

> Changed import source from 'urlparse' to 'urllib.parse'.
